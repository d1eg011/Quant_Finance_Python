HOMEWORK 1.

For each ric in a given list of rics, compute the values requested in a
given list of risk metrics and return a dataframe.

The risk metrics can change in number and order, but they always are a
subset of the following:
risk_metrics = ['ric',
                'mean',
                'std_dev',
                'skewness',
                'kurtosis',
                'var_95',
                'cvar_95',
                'sharpe',
                'jarque_bera',
                'p_value',
                'is_normal']

We will compare the resulting dataframe with our own, and based on the
number of correct entries your note will be given: 87% of correct entries
means your homework will be noted as 8.7.

To ensure the code is modulable enough, we will run a few different lists of
rics and lists of risk metrics. Each run will give a note, and your final
note will be the average of all these runs.

You can submit the homework as many times as you like until the deadline. The
final note will be the maximum note of all your submits.

After the deadline, we will send our solution.

def create_dataframe_risk_metrics(rics, risk_metrics, file_extension):
    df = pd.DataFrame()
    # columns = risk_metrics
    # number of rows = len(rics)

    # your code comes here
    # ...

    return df
